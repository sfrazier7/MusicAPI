# MusicAPI
Creating the Music App, we need to connect with many API and framework like springboot, Bootstrap, JAson. Through the postman we can transer the project to workbench to upload in database. We can operate the CRUD operation through the Springboot like creat, upadte, delete and read the file.

//Also add that the API can store different songs/tracks in a database.
